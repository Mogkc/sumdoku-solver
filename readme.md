# Sumdoku Solver
### What it does
This code solves sudoku puzzles, both normal ones that give the positions of numbers as clues and mathematical ones whose clues consist of marked-off areas. Each marked area:
- Sums to a given number
- Doesn't repeat a digit
### Why I'm making it
I was inspired to make this while reading *Eloquent Javascript*, and this project is a chance to practice concepts I learned in the book and try out TDD.
**Check out the code**, I'm pretty proud!
